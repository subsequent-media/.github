# Subsequent Media

Welcome to your all-in-one solution for creating, presenting, and consuming procedurally generated art.

## Our mission

**We seek to deliver a robust and easy-to-use entrypoint for anyone interested in creating or consuming procedurally generated art.**

There is a wide gap between:

- The musician seeking to integrate procedural generation into their creative workflow,
- The theory of how procedural generation might work in an artistic context,
- And the listener who seeks the variety and spontaneity of procedural art.

Subsequent Media seeks to create a platform that occupies this space, and to offer a space for community and common language.
